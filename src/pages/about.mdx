Hi, my name is Jonggeon Moon(pronounced _jong-gun moon_). My first name also goes as **Andrew** at various places.

I'm currently an undergraduate student at Hanyang University, majoring in Computer Science.
I've been a software engineer with a passion for building scalable and efficient systems in the past. I tend to enjoy coming up with creative solutions to complex problems and the Rust programming language.

I :sparkling_heart: video games, rock/metal music, and 3D graphics. Die-hard fan of [Polyphia](https://www.polyphia.com/) and [Sleep Token](https://www.sleep-token.com/).
Maybe a little bit of competitive programming & software engineering as well.

Below is a brief description of what I've done so far.

# Education

- Bachelor of Applied Science - BASc, Computer Software Engineering @ Hanyang University _(2020/03 ~ 2025/08)_

# Hobbywork

### Basic 3D Graphics Knowledge _(2023/01 ~ )_ - Blender, Three.js, OpenGL, WGPU

- [Shadertoy profile](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/rulerofcakes)
- [Ray tracing in One Weekend](https://github.com/RulerOfCakes/raytracing-weekend) - implemented in Rust
- Recently visited SIGGRAPH Asia 2024 in Tokyo, Japan!
- The day [Rust-GPU](https://github.com/Rust-GPU/rust-gpu) becomes production ready is when I become a graphics engineer. Actually I'm just open to the idea of it.

### Machine Learning

- I've made some DRL environments in Rust & Python to play around with DQN / PPO
  - [DRLControl](https://github.com/RulerOfCakes/drlcontrol) - Mujoco-based complex robotics environments
  - [mimic](https://github.com/RulerOfCakes/mimic) - Robotics simulation environment from Bevy & Rapier in Rust
    - Can run Pytorch-based models with PyO3 interop
    - This was supposed to be a reproduction of [DeepMimic](https://xbpeng.github.io/projects/DeepMimic/index.html) rewritten in rust, but I couldn't find any suitable physics engines in Rust at the time. (Rapier turned out to not be a good fit for this)
- [Growing Neural Cellular Automata](https://github.com/RulerOfCakes/gnca) - implemented in Rust with [Burn](https://burn.dev/)

### Game Development _(2015 ~ )_ - Unity, Unreal Engine, C#, C++

- proud member of [Hamster Powered Studio](https://www.hamsterpoweredstudio.com) since 2021
- participation in various game jams such as [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/), [Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/), etc

### Basic Translation Experience - Korean, English

- contributed in occasional community translations for video games
- semi-professional translation experience for business communications _(2020-07 ~ 2020-08) @ BigSpoon_
