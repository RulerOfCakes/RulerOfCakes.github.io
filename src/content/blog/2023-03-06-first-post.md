description: Goals to live for.

The path begins.

I do not easily say software engineering is my passion:
_I aspire to be an artist instead._ Software engineering is simply one of the methods to achieve my goals, because I naturally found out it's one of the things I'm good at.

When I say Artist, I do not mean it in a traditional way: the art I want to produce mainly consists of two properties. Quality, and Emotional resonance. Any result that satifies these two properties, I would consider as artwork produced by myself. Sadly I have made nothing that has personally satisifed these two factors for me, which is why I haven't called myself an artist yet.

Although I am relatively devoid of showing emotions in typical daily life, I try to find meaning in life from deep emotional experiences. I am extremely bad at 'small talks', because I personally find it meaningless to share thoughts that convey no meaning or value to the other person. So much that I can't really think of a light subject to talk about without getting too deep into my strange interests. I prefer much heavier, 'big talks' around their life philosophy, what they aspire to be, what their goals in life are, what they are passionate about, and why they continue to live this very moment. I find that 'heavy talks' on deep subjects that are important & meaningful to the other person provide much more value to both parties, that may possibly last much longer on each person's memory rather than a negligible fragment of everyday life.

I'm here because I want to leave a mark of my own on this world. I'm here because I want to find something that ultimately gives me the emotional satisfaction that I'll endlessly be searching for.
