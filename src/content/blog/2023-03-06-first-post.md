description: Goals to live for.
---

I do not easily say software engineering is my passion:
_I aspire to be an artist instead._ Software engineering is simply one of the methods to achieve my goals.

When I say Artist, I do not mean it in a traditional way: the art I want to produce mainly consists of two properties. Quality, and Visual satisfaction. Any result that satifies these two properties, I would consider as artwork produced by myself. Sadly I have made nothing that has personally satisifed these two factors for me, which is why I haven't called myself an artist yet.
